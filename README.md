## Documentation

## Setup

### Generate a new project

Click the Github green button [Use this template](https://github.com/cedricss/elm-batteries/generate) to generate a new public or private project from [elm-batteries](https://github.com/cedricss/elm-batteries).

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

ðŸ’¡ In the following documentation, if you use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com), run `yarn <command-name>` (instead of `npm run <command-name>`). Alternatively, you can define short aliases in your terminal to run these commands.

## Elm + Parcel

### `1` Start your Elm application

```bash
npm run start
```

> âœ“ development build and web server with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)<br/>
> âœ“ live reload<br/>
> âœ“ hot code swapping with [elm-hot](https://github.com/klazuka/elm-hot)<br/>

- Web page: http://localhost:1234

### `2` Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

> âœ“ production build with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)<br/>
> âœ“ compilation with the Elm `optimize` flag<br/>
> âœ“ minification with [`terser`](https://github.com/terser-js/terser)<br/>

ðŸ’¡ The JS code from Elm is minified with [special flags](https://elm-lang.org/0.19.0/optimize) that work for Elm apps because they have no side-effects (otherwise it would be unreliable to use such flags).

## Elm + Parcel + Netlify

### `1` Develop with serverless functions

To run serverless functions along your Elm app, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

> âœ“ development build with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)<br/>
> âœ“ web server with Parcel behind [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/#netlify-dev-beta)<br/>
> âœ“ serverless functions on your local machine<br/>

- Web page: http://localhost:8888
- Serverless function example:
  - http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/version
  - source: `functions/version/version.js`

### `2` Build for production and deploy a preview

```bash
npm run deploy
```

> âœ“ production build with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)<br/>
> âœ“ compilation with the Elm `optimize` flag<br/>
> âœ“ minification with [`terser`](https://github.com/terser-js/terser)<br/>
> âœ“ deployment to a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/welcome/) _Live Draft URL_<br/>

ðŸ’¡ If you are using Netlify for the first time, run `netlify login` to authenticate (learn more about [Netlify CLI](https://www.netlify.com/docs/cli/)).

If this preview looks good, deploy to production.

### `3` Deploy to production

```bash
npm run deploy:prod
```

> âœ“ deployment to production with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/welcome/)<br/>

ðŸ’¡ `deploy` commands are great when rapidly iterating. To avoid deploying without committing and pushing first, consider setting up continuous deployment with [Netlify Git workflow](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/).

### `bonus` Run a live session

To share your development session with a coworker, run:

```bash
npm run dev:live
```

> âœ“ development build with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)<br/>
> âœ“ live session with [Netlify Dev](https://www.netlify.com/docs/welcome/)<br/>

## Tailwind and CSS build tools

[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), an utility-first CSS framework, is included along with:

- [`postcss`](https://postcss.org/) (read [`postcss.config.js`](postcss.config.js)),
- [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to add vendor prefixes,
- [`purgecss`](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss) to remove unused selectors,
- and [`cssnano`](https://cssnano.co/) to compress the css (by default with Parcel).

`purgecss` and `cssnano` are used on production mode to minify the css. They are ignored on development mode.

## Testing

### Run Cypress

These tests are in `cypress/integration/*`. [Start your Elm app](#1-develop-with-serverless-functions) then launch the Cypress runner app:

```bash
npm run cypress:open
```

If you open one test from the list of spec files then you should see your application loaded:

![Cypress runner app](https://concat.dev/elm-cypress.png)

Alternatively, to run Cypress tests from the CLI without the GUI:

```bash
npm run cypress
```

The Elm app uses `data-*` attributes to provide context to the selectors and insulate them from CSS or JS changes. [Learn more Â»](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#Selecting-Elements)

To learn more about Cypress and play with it, [install and start it](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress.html#Installing) in a fresh new project folder: it will initialize a `cypress` folder with several examples.

**Note:** when you are not using Netlify Dev and serverless functions, start your app [directly with Parcel](#1-start-your-elm-application) and edit `cypress.json` to use the `1234` Parcel dev server port:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "http://localhost:1234"
}
```

### Run unit and fuzz tests

Install [elm-test](https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-test-runner).

These tests are in `tests/*`. To start the runner in [watch mode](https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-test-runner#--watch):

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Alternatively, run it just once:

```bash
npm run test
```

### Meta tags

[`index.html`](index.html) has meta tags included, like [Twitter Card](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started.html) tags and Open Graph tags. Make sure to update their values and the content preview image (`img/content_preview.jpg`).

### Elm

#### Navigation

- All links in an application create a [`UrlRequest`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser#UrlRequest) (read [Browser.application](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser#application)).
- A [navigation `Key`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/browser/latest/Browser-Navigation#Key) is needed to create navigation commands that change the URL: it is stored in the `Model`.
- `Nav.pushUrl` changes the address bar without starting a page load.
